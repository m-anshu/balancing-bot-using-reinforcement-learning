# Balancing Bot using Deep Reinforcement Learning and OpenAI Gym

This repository contains a project that demonstrates a balancing bot using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with OpenAI Gym. The project includes two main files:

- `initial.py`: A random agent that takes actions randomly.
- `main.py`: An intelligent agent that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning to balance the bot.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a bot that can balance itself using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The bot is trained in a simulated environment provided by OpenAI Gym. The repository includes two agents: a random agent for comparison and an intelligent agent that learns to balance the bot through training.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `tensorflow==2.12.0`
  - `gym==0.25.2`
  - `keras-rl2==1.0.5`
  - `pygame`
  - `numpy`

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

 Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-anshu/balancing-bot-using-reinforcement-learning.git
   cd balancing-bot-using-reinforcement-learning
